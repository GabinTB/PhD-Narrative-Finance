# Chapter 1 – Foundations and Literature Review of Narrative Modeling in Financial Markets


## Objectives:

This chapter provides a systematic review of the literature related to financial narratives, volatility modeling, and regime detection. Given the scale and interdisciplinarity of the relevant literature, the review is conducted using a novel algorithmic and fully reproducible framework.

The chapter covers three main strands of research:
1. Narrative economics and textual analysis in financial markets.
2. Volatility measurement, high-frequency econometrics, and regime-switching models.
3. Empirical and theoretical links between information flow, uncertainty, and market instability.

To ensure objectivity and scalability, the literature review relies on a custom algorithmic framework that automates paper discovery, classification, and relevance scoring based on textual similarity and methodological alignment.

Detailed implementation of the literature review framework is provided separately and maintained as an external submodule.
