# Chapter 3 – Volatility Dynamics and Regimes


## Objectives:

This chapter studies volatility dynamics using options and high-frequency financial data and focuses on identifying structural changes and regime shifts in market uncertainty.

The main objectives are:
- Fast and accurate computation of Implied Volatility (IV)
- Noise- and jump-robust estimation of Realized Volatility (RV, also named historical volatility) and higher-order volatility characteristics.
- Identification of volatility regimes using econometric and machine learning methods.
- Analysis of regime persistence, transitions, and market conditions associated with regime changes.

The chapter emphasizes scalable option IV computation and robust RV estimation under microstructure noise and investigates regime behavior across different asset classes and market conditions.
