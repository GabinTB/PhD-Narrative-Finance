# Introduction

Financial markets are not driven by information alone, but by how information is interpreted, framed, and shared among market participants. These interpretations form narratives that shape expectations, amplify uncertainty, and influence market dynamics beyond what can be explained by fundamentals alone.

This introduction motivates the need for a quantitative treatment of narratives in finance. It outlines the limitations of existing volatility and regime-detection frameworks when narrative effects are ignored, and argues for an integrated approach combining textual analysis with high-frequency financial data.

The chapter introduces the core research questions, defines the scope of the thesis, and positions the contribution at the intersection of narrative economics, volatility modeling, and data-driven market analysis.
