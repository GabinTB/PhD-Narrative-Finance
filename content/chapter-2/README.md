# Chapter 2 – Quantifying Financial Narratives


## Objectives:

This chapter focuses on the detection and quantification of financial narratives from large-scale textual data. The objective is to move beyond sentiment analysis and capture higher-level narrative structures and their evolution over time.

Key objectives of the chapter include:
- Defining operational criteria for what constitutes a financial narrative.
- Developing methods to extract narrative representations from heterogeneous text sources.
- Measuring narrative dynamics such as intensity, coherence, and temporal persistence.

The chapter introduces various narrative modeling pipelines based on modern NLP techniques, including embedding-based representations, Large Language Models (LLMs) and topic-level aggregation, designed to operate in rolling and high-frequency settings.
