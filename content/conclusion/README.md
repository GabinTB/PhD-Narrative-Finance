# Conclusion and Research Outlook

This thesis explores the role of financial narratives as drivers of volatility dynamics and market regime changes. The early working assumptions guiding the research are:

- Financial narratives contribute to market uncertainty in ways that are not fully captured by price-based or fundamental indicators.
- Changes in narrative structure and intensity may act as early signals of volatility regime transitions.
- RV and IV provide a suitable empirical setting to study narrative effects at both short and long horizons.
- Narrative-driven effects are heterogeneous across assets and market conditions, suggesting regime-dependent interactions.

The conclusion will synthesize the empirical findings, discuss limitations, and outline directions for future research, including extensions to forecasting, risk management, and narrative-based trading strategies.
