# Chapter 4 – Bridging Narrative Dynamics to Volatility Regimes


## Objectives:

This chapter integrates the narrative insights founds in Chapter 2 with the volatility measures identified in Chapter 3.

The objectives are:
- To identify breakpoints in both narrative and volatility timeseries.
- To analyze whether shifts in narrative dynamics precede or coincide with changes in volatility regimes.
- To study causal and predictive relationships between narratives and market uncertainty.
- To assess the economic significance of narrative-driven regime changes.

The chapter combines time-series analysis, causality testing, and regime-based evaluation to determine the extent to which narratives contribute to explaining volatility dynamics beyond traditional market variables.
