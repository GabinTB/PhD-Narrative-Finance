# Modeling Narrative Dynamics for Volatility Regime Detection in Financial Markets


## Research Question

How do financial narratives influence volatility dynamics and regime changes in financial markets?


## Research Summary

Financial markets are increasingly shaped by narratives, understood as collective interpretations that influence expectations, risk perception, and market behavior. While narratives are widely acknowledged as important drivers of market dynamics, they remain difficult to formalize and quantify within standard financial models.

This PhD research aims to bridge this gap by developing a computational framework that links the evolution of financial narratives to volatility dynamics and regime shifts in markets. The thesis integrates methods from natural language processing, high-frequency econometrics, and machine learning to:

1. Detect and quantify financial narratives across heterogeneous textual sources.
2. Measure volatility and its higher-order properties using high-frequency market data.
3. Study the causal and predictive relationships between narrative dynamics and volatility regimes.

The overarching goal is to provide a principled, data-driven approach to understanding how narrative formation, diffusion, and transformation relate to changes in market uncertainty and structural market behavior.
